<p>The Royal Institution, in collaboration with STFC, have a number of crystallography related videos on their YouTube channel.</p>

<p>More recently they have created two videos entitled 'Understanding Crystallography: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLsC4wlrR2A">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJKvDUo3KRk">Part 2</a>'.  These are great videos, the first of which features Professor Elspeth Garman from the University of Oxford, our past BCA president, talking about how we go from protein production and purirfication through to crystallisation.  The second takes these crystals, and explains how we then use facilities such as the Diamond Light Source to obtain structural information about these crystals.  This video features Professor Stephen Curry from Imperial College London.</p>

<p>There are a number of great videos on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw">channel</a>, so check them out...</p>
