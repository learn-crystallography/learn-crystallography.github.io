<p>Here you can search our resources for downloads that will help you conduct education or outreach activities. These are categorised with tags under 'age group' of your intended audience, 'type of event' that you are undertaking, the 'format' of your event and the crystallographic 'topic' that you would like to cover.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/upload/">provide us with your activities</a> and we will make them available through this site.</p>
