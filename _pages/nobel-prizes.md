<p>There have been a significant number of Nobel prizes awarded where crystallography has been one of the key aspects of the research. These have been spread across Chemistry and Physics (but with many significant aspects also related to Biological applications) and Physiology or Medicine.</p>
<p>This started in 1901 with the Nobel Prize for Physics awarded to Röntgen for his discovery of X-rays. This was followed up by Max von Laue (discovery of diffraction of X-rays by crystals) and the two Braggs who demonstrated the first determination of crystal structures.</p>

<p>Other significant Nobel Prizes were awarded to Dorothy Hodgkin for the determination of biological molecules including vitamin B12 (Chemistry 1964), Watson, Crick and Wilkins for determining the structure of DNA (Physiology or Medicine 1962) and Curl, Kroto and Smalley who discovered the fullerene form of carbon (also known as bucky balls) (Chemistry 1996).</p>
