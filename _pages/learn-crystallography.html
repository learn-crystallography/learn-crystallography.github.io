<p>Crystallography is a powerful technique that can be used to look inside materials and generate a three-dimensional picture of the arrangement of atoms and molecules inside a <a title="What is a Crystal?" href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/learn-crystallography/what-is-a-crystal/">crystal</a>.  Why do we want to do this?  Because to understand how things work we often need to know how the atoms and molecules are connected.  We can use this technique to look at things from simple ionic materials like table salt all the way through to the complex molecules that are found in your body such as proteins, viruses and your DNA!  Crystallography is used by scientists in all scientific disciples including Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Space Science!  On these pages you can find out more about some of these areas.</p>
<p>The discovery of X-ray diffraction by the father and son team, William and Lawrence Bragg (with some help from others such as Max von Laue) 100 years ago revolutionised the scientific world allowing scientists to unambiguously visualise the arrangement of atoms and molecules.  You can find out more about the history of Crystallography <a title="History of Crystallography" href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/learn-crystallography/history/">here</a>.  At the outset of their research, the Braggs could never have anticipated the impact that it would have even today!  There have been nearly 30 Nobel Prizes awarded which have made use of Crystallography awarded in Physics, Chemistry and Biology!  You can find out more about these <a title="Nobel Prizes in Crystallography" href="http://learn.crystallography.org.uk/learn-crystallography/nobel-prizes/">here</a>.</p>
